# Azure Journey: From Infrastructure to Deployment and Beyond  

Welcome to **Azure Journey** – a comprehensive guide documenting my exploration, challenges, and triumphs in Microsoft Azure. This repository captures my hands-on experience with Azure, from managing infrastructure and deploying applications to monitoring, optimizing, and securing cloud workloads.  

## 🌍 The Path We Travel  

### 1. **Setting Up the Foundation**  
Every journey begins with the first step—**understanding Azure’s core services**. We start by:  
- **Creating and managing Azure subscriptions** (Pay-As-You-Go, Enterprise Agreements).  
- **Navigating the Azure Portal & Azure CLI** for efficient cloud management.  
- **Resource Groups & Tagging Strategies** to keep deployments organized.  

📂 *Example:* [Azure Resource Organization](./1-Foundation/Resource-Management)  

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with ARM & Terraform**  
Manual deployments are error-prone—**automation is key**. Here, we:  
- Define infrastructure using **ARM Templates** (Azure Resource Manager).  
- Leverage **Terraform** for multi-cloud and modular deployments.  
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines for IaC** (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).  

📂 *Example:* [Terraform Azure VM Deployment](./2-IaC/Terraform-Azure-VM)  

### 3. **Networking & Security in Azure**  
A secure and well-architected network is crucial. This phase covers:  
- **Virtual Networks (VNet), Subnets, and NSGs** for segmentation.  
- **Azure Firewall & Application Gateway** for traffic control.  
- **Private Endpoints & Azure Bastion** for secure access.  

📂 *Example:* [Hub-Spoke Network Architecture](./3-Networking/Hub-Spoke-Model)  

### 4. **Compute & Storage Solutions**  
Choosing the right compute and storage is vital for performance and cost. We explore:  
- **Azure VMs, App Services, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.  
- **Blob Storage, Azure SQL, and Cosmos DB** for data persistence.  
- **Managed Disks & Azure Files** for scalable storage.  

📂 *Example:* [Deploying a Web App on Azure App Service](./4-Compute/App-Service-Deployment)  

### 5. **DevOps & CI/CD Pipelines**  
From code to cloud—**automating deployments** ensures speed and reliability. We:  
- Set up **Azure DevOps Pipelines & GitHub Actions**.  
- Implement **Blue-Green & Canary Deployments** in AKS.  
- Use **Azure Monitor & Application Insights** for observability.  

📂 *Example:* [CI/CD for a .NET App with Azure DevOps](./5-DevOps/Azure-Pipelines-Demo)  

### 6. **Monitoring, Logging & Cost Optimization**  
A well-monitored system is a healthy system. Here, we:  
- Configure **Azure Monitor Alerts & Log Analytics**.  
- Track costs with **Azure Cost Management**.  
- Optimize spending using **Reserved Instances & Spot VMs**.  

📂 *Example:* [Setting Up Alerts for Azure Functions](./6-Monitoring/Azure-Monitor-Alerts)  

### 7. **Security & Compliance**  
Security is non-negotiable. We dive into:  
- **Azure Policy & Azure Blueprints** for governance.  
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for threat protection.  
- **Managed Identities & Key Vault** for secrets management.  

📂 *Example:* [Enforcing Compliance with Azure Policy](./7-Security/Azure-Policy-Demo)  

### 8. **Serverless & Event-Driven Architectures**  
Going serverless for scalability and cost efficiency:  
- **Azure Functions & Logic Apps** for automation.  
- **Event Grid & Service Bus** for event-driven workflows.  

📂 *Example:* [Serverless File Processing with Azure Functions](./8-Serverless/File-Processing-Function)  

### 9. **AI & Machine Learning in Azure**  
Exploring Azure’s AI capabilities:  
- **Azure Machine Learning Studio** for model training.  
- **Cognitive Services** for vision, speech, and NLP.  

📂 *Example:* [Building a Sentiment Analysis Bot](./9-AI/Sentiment-Analysis-Demo)
